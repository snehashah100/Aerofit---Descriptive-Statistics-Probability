Only about 20% customers look for purchasing the Pro level treadmill.
8. Most of the customers (about 60%) are from the age-group of 20-30 i.e. treadmills are more preferred by young adults.
9. Number of male customers are more in almost all age groups which indicates males are more health conscious.
10. Most of the age groups are prefering to purchase the Entry-level treadmill but customers of age group 30-35 have preferred the Midlevel treadmill. Also Pro-level treadmills are mostly preferred by age group from 21-30.
11. Most of the customers are of 20-30 age group and most of them have a Income in the range 35000-55000 annually.
12. We can see a trend that rich, more educated and elderly age group seems less interested in treadmills.
13. Although the Average Income of the 20-25 age-group is less(45000 dollars annually) but most of the revenue of the company iscomming from this age-group itself.
14. Maximum customers are in the range of 45000-55000 dollars annual income.

from the income range of 75000 to 105000 dollars.
17. The Avg. Income of the customers buying the pro level treadmill is very high which is expected. But there not much difference in the Average incomes of customers purchasing Entry level and Mid level which indicates that the customers purchasing entry level treadmill can also afford mid level if they find enough value in it.
18. Customers purchasing Entry and Mid level treadmills are having almost similar fitness but the customers of Pro level have very good fitness levels and most probably they will try to maintain and improve it. So customers with good fitness levels are more likely to go for a Pro-level treadmill purchase.

# Business Recommendations:-
1. Company should focus more on the age group of 20-30 years as young adults are more inclined towards fitness.
2. Company should promote KP481 more to the Income class of 45000 and above as there is very less price difference between
KP281 and KP481, also this income range can afford the KP481 easily.
3. Company should try to introduce another product in between KP481 and KP781 because the price difference between them is
significant and also the sales numbers have significant difference. If there was an option at about 2000 dollars then may be
customers would have more convenience of choice at equal interval of price points.
4. Customers having good fitness will tend to buy treadmill with more features and customization options. So company should
recommend the high-end treadmills with more customization options to them.
5. If the customer is partnered then company should promote/recommend Mid level treadmills to them as there is a higher probability of
them purchasing KP481.
6. Advertisments/promotions of treadmills should be attractive specially targeting the age group of 20-35 years.
7. Since most of the sales is of the Entry level treadmill(about 44.45%), so company should try to improve the margins in KP281 and
make it more efficient and introduce some customization options for the customers with small additional costs which will
automatically make customers think to go for Mid level treadmill purchase. This will increase the overall profatibility of the company to some extent
